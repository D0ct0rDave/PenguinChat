# PenguiChat

This application started as a substitution of PonyChat, a chat based on mailslots we used on our video game studio. One of my collegues hacked PonyChat so he could impersonate each of the rest o the team mates, which lend to many funny and also some compromised situations.

This applicaiton started as a sustitution and improvement, by adding a kind of encription to the protocol to avoid this problem in the studio.

Another feature was the addition of avatars per user, and also the possibility of transferring images from one host to the rest.
